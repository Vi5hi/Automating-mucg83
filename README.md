# Automating-mucg83-by-Harry-Badeshia
In this project I am gonna automate a very powerful software mucg83 automatic, this software give you the thermodynamic properties of low alloy steel as and take input as compositions.
I am assuming that you have input file in tabular form in such a way that its comoposition are same as the mucg83 input sequence.
The code given will extract the thermodynamic values from the output window at 250 degree celceus you can change temparature as per you requarment.
The output will be saved in a csv file along with the composition (input + output).
